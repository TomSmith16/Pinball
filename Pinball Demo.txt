Gravity
	- Larger gravity downpull in the Y to stop the ball taking air as easily, 

Materials
	- Material to represent the coefficient of restitution of steel ball bearing for ball.
	- Material to represent point scoring obstacles and to give bounce, bumper material with a larger coefficient of restiution than 1.

Floor
	- Large box object to be coloured differently from walls

Walls 
	- All game walls are in a separate class, 
	- neatens the code, 
	- allows for compound object movement,

Ball
	- Sphere class, 
	- Collision filtering with the collision groups of other obstacles in the level.
	
	- Starts kinematic before launcher is pressed.

Flippers
	- Convex mesh shapes
	- Collision filtering with ball collision group to enable CCD

Revolute Joints
	- Joins the two actors specified (if two) in the specified points in space. 
	- This connects the wedge to the point in space on the table where the wedge has placed,
	- The joint is also rotated and translated in such a way that the wedge rotates around the correct angle
	- and not around the centre of the flipper.

Baton
	- Spinning box with collision filtering and revolute joint to hold in place on the table.
	- Scoring points through collision.

Glass & Glass Walls
	- Box and Wall classes used to create a see through roof on the table to stop the ball from taking air
	- Set kinematic so that it doesn't move
	- Set the shapes flag visualization to false, 
	- then implemented a check for each shapes flag in the renderer to see whether the bit(&) containing the visualisation flag is true or false 

Deadzone
	- Box created to be a trigger for beneath the flippers, set to kinematic and a trigger, also set visualisation to false.
	- When triggered the player will lose a life, and the game will reset, and carry score over rounds, 
	- If the player loses all lives then the game will restart.

SpawnBlock
	- Trigger that will trigger when the ball leaves it, will block off spawn to avoid the ball going back down to the launcher when in play.
	- Also a check on the launcher to see if the ball is in spawn, if it is then the spawnblock will despawn in case of a botched launch.

Tube Trigger
	- Trigger in the tube for the changing direction of the baton in the middle. 
	- Also trigger to give points.

Plunger 
	- Trampoline for launcher and on the right
	- Right plunger uses triggers to launch ball on contact and block off after it has been fired.
	- Launcher uses space to launch
	- Stiffness and Dampness altered on button press and release to fire ball.

Platform and Under Trigger
	- Elevated boxes with ramp to lead ball up.
	- Varying level geometry experimenting with rotations and compound shapes.

Obstacles and capsules
	- Collision filters set up for the capsules to score points on
	- Given the bumper materials for bouncier effect like regular pinball.

Trigger checks
	- Triggers are checked with bools, constantly checked in the custom update 1/60seconds.
	- *see custom update*

Collision 
	- OnContact check added new flags to check for CCD on filter groups such as bumpers or flippers,
	- Function to check object name to determine score, similar action in triggers.

Key Functionality
	- Z & / = Left/Right Flippers
	- x & . = Left/Right tilt and nudge counters, and tilt, different HUD used.
	- Lives and score updated live on HUD, High score tracked by game session, could have done text files.
